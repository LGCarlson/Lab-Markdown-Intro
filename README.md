# Lab-Markdown-Intro

**Purpose:** The purpose of this repository is to provide a home for R Markdown teaching materials and fun examples that I've created. 

You can find a version of Intro_to_RMarkdown.Rmd on my [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/lgcarlson/Rmdintro). 



## What is R Markdown? 

>"R Markdown allows you to create documents that serve as a record of your analysis. In the world of reproducible research, we want other researchers to easily understand what we did in our analysis, otherwise nobody can be certain that you analysed your data properly. **You might choose to create an RMarkdown document as an appendix to a paper or project assignment that you are doing, upload it to an online repository such as Github, or simply to keep as a personal record so you can quickly look back at your code and see what you did.** 
>
>RMarkdown presents your code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with conventional text to explain it, a bit like a notebook."
>
>RMarkdown uses Markdown syntax. Markdown is a very simple ‘markup’ language which provides methods for creating documents with headers, images, links etc. from plain text files, while keeping the original plain text file easy to read."

## Why R Markdown? 
### Pros

* Reproducbility (both for others and your future self)
* Did I mention reproducibility? With one click (literally), you can reproduce an entire analysis if your dataset is updated, etc 
* Organization (where did I put that .csv or ggsave object?)
* Share-ability (easily share or publish knitted files to HTML/RPubs)
* Annotate-ability (now I'm just making these up... Markdown makes it easy to annotate your code)
* Insert chunks of Python, Bash, SQL code
* Treat chunks like functions
* Make a website

### Cons

* There are no cons

Truly, I love using RMarkdown to create stylish and easy to read products for both myself and others. I hope you find this information useful.
